Econometric-Modelling-of-Cointegration-Between-Total-Consumer-Utilisation-TCU-and-Inflation

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project performs a comprehensive time series analysis of **Inflation**, represented by the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, and **Capacity Utilisation**, represented by the **Total Consumer Utilization (TCU)** rate. The analysis employs various econometric techniques to investigate the dynamic relationship between these two critical economic indicators. 

Objectives
- To assess whether inflation and capacity utilisation are stationary over time.
- To explore the long-run and short-run relationships between inflation and capacity utilisation using cointegration techniques.
- To model the interdependencies between the two-time series through Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Models (VEC).
- To analyse the causal relationships and the effects of shocks through Granger causality tests and impulse response functions.
